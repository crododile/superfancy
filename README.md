superfancy
==========
include flip.js in your script tags

a fancy fan to show off a few views

Dependencies --> Jquery, html5 transitions

to use place several 'divs' with the class '.page' inside of a container div ie. '.container'

then on document ready call accordion($('.container'))

add your own styles to the 'page' elements for things such as coloring.

The javascript should be pretty approachable so feel free to tweak it.

enjoy the breezee....
