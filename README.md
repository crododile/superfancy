==========
include flip.js in your script tags

a fancy fan to show off a few views

Dependencies --> Jquery, html5 transitions

to use place several 'divs' with the class '.page' inside of a container div ie. '.container'

then on document ready call accordion($('.container'))

The CSS for the '.page' class and the container are entirely your responsibility.

The javascript should be pretty approachable so feel free to tweak it.

For the gap, I've been coloring the containing element the same color as the default color for now.

enjoy the breezee....
